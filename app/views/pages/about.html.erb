		<h1>Welcome to Teudu.</h1>
		
		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p class="paragraphtext">
		Last year, President Cohon posed a question to his student advisory council: is Carnegie Mellon fun? After some discussion, the students came to the conclusion that while there are a number of diverse interesting events on campus students just don't know about them: publicity and discovery are problems. Teudu was born as an answer: a highly visual, interactive, and most important, filterable, advertising medium.

		<h2>How can I submit my events?</h2>
		<p class="paragraphtext">
		Currently, only members of student organizations can add events to Teudu. If you are a member of a student organization and wish to have access to the Teudu system, please contact our <a href="mailto:teudumoderator@gmail.com">moderator</a>.
